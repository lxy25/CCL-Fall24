    <h1>Mirror, Mirror</h1>
    <div class="box box-1">There’s a hidden language in every face, a story told through the delicate lines, shapes, and
      expressions that make each of us who we are. In a world where beauty is often defined by standards, this project
      invites you to look deeper—beyond the surface, beyond the expected. It challenges the notion of perfection and
      instead asks:
      <br><strong>What if beauty isn’t a universal ideal, but something uniquely yours?</strong>
      <br>True beauty begins not with what is commonly seen, but with what has often been overlooked—the subtle details
      that
      make up the intricate map of your features. Step into a space where self-love is not a trend, but a revelation.
      Where the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and every curve, every contour, is celebrated for the masterpiece it is.
      <br>The question remains: <strong>What will you find when you learn to truly see yourself?
      </strong>

      <!-- <div class="box box-M1"><strong>"You're so skinny you look disgusting"
        </strong></div><br>

    <div class="box box-2">In a world dominated by filters, quick judgments, and narrow beauty standards, we’ve lost
      sight
      of what it means to truly see ourselves and each other. Constantly bombarded by images that dictate what’s
      "beautiful" or "acceptable," we’ve allowed superficial ideals to define our worth. Behind the jokes, the insults,
      and the stereotypes lies a harsh reality: beauty isn’t one-size-fits-all.
    </div><br>

    <div class="box box-3">This is a reminder that our features—every curve, every line—are not flaws to be hidden, but
      aspects of a unique and powerful story. We’ve been taught to ridicule what’s different, to degrade what doesn’t
      fit
      the mold, but this only keeps us trapped in an illusion built on fear and prejudice.
      <br>When we stop listening to these insults and start seeing with clarity, we break free from the confines of
      societal standards. We begin to see beauty in its truest, most diverse form. And in doing so, we reclaim the power
      to love ourselves—just as we are.
    </div>
   
    <div class="box box-6"><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
      1. Turn on your camera and position it to capture your full face, ensuring all your features are visible.<br>
      2. Next, use your mouse to tap on the unique features that stand out to you <strong>(eyes, lips, nose, cheeks)</strong>!
      </div><br><div id="p5-canvas-container"></div> 
    <div class="box box-5"></div>instruction<br>
    <div class="box box-4">In a world often dominated by criticism, it’s easy to forget the power of a simple
      compliment.
      Yet, affirmation has the ability to shift how we see ourselves and others. True beauty isn’t just what’s visible
      on
      the surface;<br> it’s in <strong>the unique qualities that make us who we are</strong>.<br> Every feature—whether a smile, a glance, or a
      gesture—holds its own form of strength and grace. Compliments remind us to pause, appreciate, and celebrate these
      often-overlooked details, helping us reconnect with our true selves and recognize the beauty we sometimes forget
      to
      see.
