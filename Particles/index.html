  <h1>Petal World</h1>
  <p>It's finally spring! What could be more romantic than watching cherry blossom petals drift gently from the tree? Like something out of a movie, it almost feels as though the petals have a mind of their own—each one following the other, floating gracefully through the air. They seem to fall towards the ground, but do they really? In this project, we explore the unusual path of a flower petal. It spirals and drifts downward, but never quite reaches the ground. Instead, it feels like an illusion, as if the petal’s journey always starts over—circling and floating again, in a beautiful, endless cycle.
