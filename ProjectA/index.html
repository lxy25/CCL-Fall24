                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>A cute little fish that is just a bit shy to see you! Taking the shape of a traditional fish, it is special by its color & size-changing body.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fluctuates in size</li>
                    <li>Color-changing</li>
                    <li>Loves *your* worms</li>

            <p> <span class="yellow">What we know so far about this creature:</span> Despite there being two fishing rods, each time you try to feed it, it will come towards you and choose your bait <br> <i>(that other one didn't look that good anyways...)</i> <br> When there is only the gold bait available, it would rather swim around, seemingly always waiting for something... or someone? 
                <p> <span class="yellow">  Guidelines for human interaction with this creature: </span> Click anywhere in the water to feed fishursula, it will go to wherever your mouse is. However, make sure to still stay so it can get your bait! Press "r" on your keyboard to regenerate a worm! At the same time, Fishursula will change to a whole new fish (change color and size).
